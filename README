This is my MisterHouse configuration.

Misc. info about my setup:

 * Weather is fetched using a modified internet_weather.pl that uses city_nws for conditions and city for
   forecast, as my particular city has different names for each query

 * Bluetooth speakers in the bedroom can be connected / disconnected using DBus

 * Boxee will turn the lights off in the living room when watching a video longer than an hour (a movie)
